# Register a New Patient

**Registering a patient creates the tenant-scoped identity every order, sample, and result later attaches to.** This recipe walks the Front Desk flow end to end. Required permission: `patients.create`. The full field-by-field reference lives in the [Patient Management module](/docs/modules/patient-management).
